# Major_Indian_Rivers-and-World_Population-
Using Folium and Panda to display major Indian rivers and population of the world.

Folium makes it easy to visualize data thatâ€™s been manipulated in Python on an interactive Leaflet map. It enables both the binding of data to a map for choropleth visualizations as well as passing Vincent/Vega visualizations as markers on the map.
The library has a number of built-in tilesets from OpenStreetMap, MapQuest Open, MapQuest Open Aerial, Mapbox, and Stamen, and supports custom tilesets with Mapbox or Cloudmade API keys. Folium supports both GeoJSON and TopoJSON overlays, as well as the binding of data to those overlays to create choropleth maps with color-brewer color schemes.

In computer programming, pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. It is free software released under the three-clause BSD license.The name is derived from the term "panel data", an econometrics term for data sets that include observations over multiple time periods for the same individuals.

CSV (Comma Separated Values) is a simple file format used to store tabular data, such as a spreadsheet or database. A CSV file stores tabular data (numbers and text) in plain text. Each line of the file is a data record. Each record consists of one or more fields, separated by commas. The use of the comma as a field separator is the source of the name for this file format.For working CSV files in python, there is an inbuilt module called csv.
